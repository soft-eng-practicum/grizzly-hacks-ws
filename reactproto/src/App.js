function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="App">
        {/* Since we want the Nav bar to load into every page, we won't put it into <Switch>. Saame goes for the Footer at the bottom */}
        <Nav />
        {/* 
        We are using Switch because as soon it finds the route with that specific path
        that is the only component that will render out. Everything else doesn't matter
              */}
        <Switch>
          {/* Route: Renders out a component based on the URL

          Path: Define path that should render out
          need to specify the componenet aka {Componenet}
          When you enter the name in the URL
          Ex: www.blank.com/about
          This will render the about page. If we did www.blank.com/FAQ
          The it will render FAQ page. etc

          You may notice that we have a path = "/" this is basically
          what the page will load first AKA Homepage.
          As soon as it reaches "/" it will render that page AKA Home. Fix that by using the
          "exact". So when you specifically ask for "/" that component will render out
          Anything that comes after won't work (Try it)

          I also added a 404 page incase the user tries entering a path that does not exist.
          You can try it if you want. Do something like http://localhost:3000/wrong and it'll give you the 404 page 
           Maybe we can make it look nicer later 

           I believe the order of these matter but I'm not sure but you know what they say "If it's not broken  don't touch it!"
